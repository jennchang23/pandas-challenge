# Below is my analysis on the Heroes of Pymoli data

  # 1. Game should look into expanding female user base
        # Although they make up ~14% of the overall user population, female gamers are more profitable than male gamers
          # $0.18 higher average purchase price
          # $0.40 higher avg total purchase per person
          
  # 2. Adults 20-24 comprise the largest age population (45%), however, Adults 35-39 have the highest avg purchase and highest avg total purchase per person - possibly due to higher disposable income
  
  # 3. "Oathbreaker, Last Hope of the Breaking Storm" is the most popular/purchased item, making it the highest in terms of total purchase value despite being cheaper than other items in the game.
